# WIP bindings for https://github.com/cimgui/cimgui

Does not work yet.

## Precompiled binaries

The precompiled binaries in the repo (under `windows` and `linux`) are not meant for public use and only serve for my own convenience. I don't have any way to prove that these are fault-free, and thus would highly recommend you re-build your own binaries when using these bindings following the instructions in the submodule.
