# WIP bindings for https://github.com/cimgui/cimgui

The example at `examples/basic.c` runs, but there's no OpenGL or other bindings to visually confirm that everything works. So far we only get `imgui.ini` which looks correct.

## Precompiled binaries

The precompiled binaries in the repo (under `windows` and `linux`) are not meant for public use and only serve for my own convenience. I don't have any way to prove that these are fault-free, and thus would highly recommend you re-build your own binaries when using these bindings following the instructions in the submodule.
